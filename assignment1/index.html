      <h2>
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h2>
      <p>
        an anthropomorphised avatar that talks to you, the styling is very
        lighthearted, cartoony style. little animations that bring character to
        the webpage horizontal scrolling & displaying on virtual screens instead
        of directly on the webpage brings novelty. there's more materiality to
        the experience.
      </p>
      <h2>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h2>
      <p>
        just a couple of times to play around with all the fun ui elements and
        look at his work. not for very long scrolling and clicking. a bit of
        scrolling, mostly scrolling. then clicking. thats about it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are only 3 separate pages, and a link that redirects you to
        another site.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          at first the power button on the avatar flickers, drawing attention to
          it. when it is hovered over, it grows bigger in size, indicating that
          it is clickable.
        </li>
        <li>the character talks, then "please scroll" appears</li>
        <li>some clickable elements change when hovered over</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h2>
      <h2>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?

      <h2>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h2>
      <p>like you're having fun/being engaged, interested in the content</p>
      <h2>
        12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h2>
      <p>
        there wasn't much that was frustrating, but one thing that kind of
        interrupted the flow a little was the fact that i would try to access
        links by clicking on an image, but later realise that it was only the
        text that was clickable. Some clickable elements react when hovered
        over, but others don't so you just have to guess.

        13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?

      <p>i liked scrolling on the virtual screens</p>
