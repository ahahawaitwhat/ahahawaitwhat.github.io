                The most satisfying action was clicking on the power button on
                the avatar, as there was instant feedback with the animations. I
                think it was the most tactile experience on the website, with
                the button enlargening while being hovered over, the subtle
                shrinking when clicked, and the speech bubble that appears
                instantaneously.

                an anthropomorphised avatar that talks to you, the styling is

                character to the webpage horizontal scrolling & displaying on
                virtual screens instead of directly on the webpage brings
                novelty. there's more materiality to the experience.

                there wasn't much that was frustrating, but one thing that kind
                of interrupted the flow a little was the fact that i would try
                to access links by clicking on an image, but later realise that
                it was only the text that was clickable. Some clickable elements
                react when hovered over, but others don't so you just have to
                guess.
